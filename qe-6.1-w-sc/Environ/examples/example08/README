This example shows how to use pw.x to calculate the solvation energy
and other related solvation quantities for a water molecule in a water solvent.

The calculation is exactly the same as in example01, but for the use of a 
preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm for the optimization of the polarization
charge/potential.
