           including electrostatic/cavitation/PV contributions
example02: pw.x 
           use of different periodic boundary correction schemes for charged isolated systems
	   in vacuum and in solution: Makov-Payne, Martyna-Tuckerman, Point-Counter-Charge (parabolic)
example03: pw.x 
           use of parabolic correction for periodic boundary conditions in
