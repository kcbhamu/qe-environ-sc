This example shows how to use the pw.x and turbo_davidson.x codes
to calculate the absorption spectrum of the CH4 molecule in water
using a fully self-consistent dielectric defined on the electronic density
and using the Davidson algorithm within the time-dependent density
functional perturbation theory according to 
I. Timrov, O. Andreussi, A. Biancardi, N. Marzari, and S. Baroni, J. Chem. Phys. 142, 034111 (2015).

The description of the keywords for the turbo_davidson.x code
can be found in TDDFPT/Doc of the Quantum ESPRESSO package.
