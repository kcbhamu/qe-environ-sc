This example shows how to use cp.x to calculate the electrostatic solvation energy
and other related solvation quantities for a water molecule in a water solvent.

The calculation is a damped electron dynamics (thus missing the ionic relaxation),
but in the presence of a continuum dielectric with the shape defined
by the electronic density, according to the  model of Fattebert 
and Gygi, Int J Quantum Chem 93, 139 (2003), revised by O. Andreussi, I. Dabo 
and N. Marzari, J. Chem. Phys. 136, 064102 (2012) 

Note that, for the time being, no PBC correction has been used for the calculations 
in vacuum and in the solvent.

A rough explanation of the different keywords of the solvation model is 
in the run_example.sh file.
