Quantum Espresso 6.1 with the Environ module modified to allow for the calculation of equilibrium semiconductor-solution interfaces. 

Install as you normally would quantum espresso and then follow directions for the typical installation of the Environ module. 
See http://www.quantum-environment.org/installation.html

The example folder provides a series of inputs for a silicon slab in contact with water. 
It also contains scripts allowing for the rapid creation of several charges at once and the easy compilation of q-v files.
